  1.     Click the Data Set button at the bottom of the form.
                    
  2.     Click the Sidebar button at the bottom of the form.
                
  3.     Select the DataSet in the LBWork listbox.
           
  4.     Click the Set button in the button stack. 

  Note: A default DataSet switch can be set in config.txt to auto select the 
               last DataSet selected on startup.



  Configuration:

  The QuickList.exe can be installed in a seperate directory from the DataSet
  allowing for multiple DataSets, Address Book, List of household items, autos, 
  references.

  This requires a configuration file to be set up pointing to the install of the 
  exectuable and data.

  My working install:

   D:/QLUI
      installation.txt
      mypath.txt
      short.txt                     {This text file}
