    procedure Assert(Expr : Boolean;  const Msg : string);

  Note: With assertions on, Assert tests if expr is false, and if so, aborts the
              application with a Runtime error 227 and an optional error message
              in msg. If expr is true, program execution continues normally. If
              assertions are not enabled at compile time, this routine does
              nothing, and no code is generated for the Assert call. Enabling and
              disabling assertions at compile time is done via the \$C or 
              \$ASSERTIONS compiler switches. These are global switches. The
              default behavior of the assert call can be changed by setting a new
              handler in the AssertErrorProc variable. Sysutils overrides the
              default handler to raise a EAssertionFailed exception.
