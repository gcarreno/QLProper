  Special thanks to TRon and howardpc who helped me immensely.

  A SQLite3 Free Pascal/Lazarus program can be implemented it two ways.
  (As Far as I lnow) One is using the required components and coding the 
  properties and events in the controls.
  
  The second way is to do it by coding functions and procedures in you
  project 

  I will attempt to do both step by step.

   xBuild Components will do the compomemt build and XBuild Code will be
   the Code build.

  They are named XBuild and XCode for colating reasons.
