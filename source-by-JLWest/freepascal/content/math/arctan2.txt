    function ArcTan2(y :  Float;  x :  Float) : Float;
 
  Note: ArcTan2 calculates arctan(y/x), and returns an angle in the correct
             quadrant. The returned angle will be in the range $-\pi$ to $\pi$
             radians. The values of x and y must be between -2\^{}64 and 2\^{}64, 
             moreover x should be different from zero. On Intel systems this
             function is implemented with the native intel fpatan instruction.
