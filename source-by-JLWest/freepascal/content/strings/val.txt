  uses ... system;

    procedure Val(const S : string; var V; var Code : Word);

  Note: Val converts the value  S to a numerical value or  an enumerated value, and 
              stores this value in the variable V, which can be of type Longint, Real and
              byte or any enumerated type. If the conversion isn't succesfull, then the 
              parameter Code contains the index of the  character in S which prevented 
              the conversion.  The string S is allowed to contain spaces in the 
              beginning.
