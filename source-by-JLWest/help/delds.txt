 Replacing a deleted DataSet:

 A deleted DataSet is a directory with several sub-directories. The top
 level directory is the name of the DataSet. It should be in the system Trash
 bin. Use windows to restore the directory.

 Providing it is restored edit the config.txt file located in 
 theinstalldirectory/files/config.txt. It will look something like this:

  PhoneBook                                     |C:\phonebook.txt|5000|

 Add the deleted DataSet.

 HouseAccounts                             |C:\houseaccounts.txt|6000|
