*M1

  Open the project SQLCopoments. Expand the main main form to 1/2 of
  your screen size. Set the form to open in the center of the Desltop and as 
  the primary form. Here is where the Font and Font size should be set. Set
  Form1.Caption to SQLite3Compomemts.

  Drop the following components on the main form.

               SQLQuerry		Toolbar>SQLdb		1st on the left
               SQLite3Connectio	Toolbar>SQLdb 		5th from right	
               DataSource		Toolbar>Data Access 	1st position
               DBGrid		Toobar>Data Control	2nd from right
               DBNavigator

  Select Menu>View>Components. In the Filter type tdb and select 
  TDBNavigator.  ( I can never find TDBNavigator in the toolbar ) 

  Resize the grid to half the form size and center it on the form. Place the 
  DBNavigator under the grid centered. Stack the components to the right
  of the DBGrid.
