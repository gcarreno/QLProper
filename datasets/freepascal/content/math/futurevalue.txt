    function FutureValue(ARate: Float; NPeriods: Integer;  APayment: Float;
                                              APresentValue: Float;  APaymentTime: TPaymentTime ) :
                                              Float;
  Note: FutureValue calculates the future value of an investment (FV) in the cash 
              flow formula (see CashFlowFunctions) The function result is the future value 
              of an investment of APresentValue (PV), where APayment (PMT) is invested
              for NPeriods (n) at the rate of ARate (q) per period.
                
              The APaymentTime parameter determines whether the investment
              (payment) is an ordinary annuity or an annuity due: ptEndOfPeriod 
              must be used if payments are at the end of each period. If the payments are
              at the beginning of the periode, ptStartOfPeriod must be used.
