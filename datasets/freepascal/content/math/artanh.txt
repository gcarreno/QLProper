    function ArTanH(x : Float) : Float;
 
  Note: ArTanH returns the inverse hyperbolic tangent of its argument x, 
             where x should lie in the interval [-1,1], borders included. The arctanh
             variant of this function is supplied for Delphi compatibility. Errors
             In case x is not in the interval [-1,1], an EInvalidArgument exception
             is raised.
