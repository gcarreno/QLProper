    function IOResult: Word;

  Note: IOresult contains the result of any input/output call, when the {\$i-} 
              compiler directive is active, disabling IO checking. When the flag is 
              read, it is reset to zero. If IOresult is zero, the operation completed 
              successfully. If non-zero, an error occurred. 

            The following errors can occur:

                                                       Dos errors :
