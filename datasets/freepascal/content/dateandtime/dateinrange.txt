    function DateInRange(ADate: TDate; AStartDate: TDate;  AEndDate: TDate;
                                               AInclusive: Boolean = True) : Boolean;

    Borwe: DateInRange checks whether the value ADate lies between AStartDate 
                   and AEndDate, and returns True if it is. When AInclusive is True
                   (the default), then the limits are included. When AInclusive is False, the
                   limits are excluded. Only the date part of the 3 parameters is considered.
