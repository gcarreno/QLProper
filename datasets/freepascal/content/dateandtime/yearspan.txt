    function YearSpan(const ANow: TDateTime;  const AThen: TDateTime) : Double;

 Note:  YearSpan returns the number of years between ANow and AThen, including
              any fractional parts of a year. This number is an approximation, based on an 
              average number of days of 365.25 per year (average over 4 years).
