  uses ... system;

    function Pred( X : TOrdinal ) : TOrdinal;

  Notes: Pred returns the element that precedes X. If it is applied to the 
               first value of the ordinal type, and the program was compiled with
              range checking on ({$R+}), then a run-time error will be generated.
