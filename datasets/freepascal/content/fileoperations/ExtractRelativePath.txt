  None: ExtractRelativePath constructs a relative path to go from BaseName to 
               DestName. If DestName is on another drive (Not on Unix-like platforms)
               then the whole Destname is returned. The directories must end on a path
               delimiter for this function to work correctly. If not, the last part is stripped
               and treated as a file name.
