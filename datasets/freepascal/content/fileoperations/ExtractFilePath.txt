    function ExtractFilePath(const FileName : UNICODESTRING) : UNICODESTRING;

    function ExtractFilePath(const FileName : RAWBYTESTRING) : RAWBYTESTRING;

  Note: ExtractFilePath returns the path part (including drive letter) from 
              FileName. The path consists of all characters before the last directory 
              separator character ('/' or '\'), including the directory separator itself. In 
              case there is only a drive letter, that will be returned.
                 
              The full filename can always be reconstructed by concatenating the result of
              ExtractFilePath and ExtractFileName.
