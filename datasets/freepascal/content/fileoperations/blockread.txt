  Note: Blockread reads count or less records from file F. A record is a block of bytes 
              with size specified by the Rewrite or Reset statement. The result is placed in 
              buffer, which must contain enough room for Count records. The function
              cannot read partial records. If Result is specified, it contains the number of 
              records actually read. If Result isn't specified, and less than Count records
              ere read, a run-time error is generated. This behavior can be controlled by
              the {$I} switch.
