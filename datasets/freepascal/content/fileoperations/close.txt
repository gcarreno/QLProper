  uses ... system;

    procedure Close(var f: file);

    procedure Close(var t: Text);

  Note:  Close flushes the buffer of the file F and closes F. After a call to Close, data
               can no longer be read from or written to F. To reopen a file closed with
               Close, it isn't necessary to assign the file again. A call to Reset or Rewrite is 
               sufficient.
  See: Assign, Reset, Rewrite, Flush
