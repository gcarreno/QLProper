    function ExpandFileNameCase(const FileName : RAWBYTESTRING;
                                                                 out MatchFound: TFilenameCaseMatch):
                                                                 RAWBYTESTRING;

  Note: On case insensitive platforms, ExpandFileNameCase behaves similarly
               to ExpandFileName except for the fact that it returns the final part of
               the path with the same case of letters as found on the disk 
               (if it exists - otherwise the case equals the one provided on input). 
               On case sensitive platforms it also checks whether one or more full 
               paths exist on disk which would correspond to the provided input if
               treated case insensitively and returns the first such match found and 
               information whether the match is unique or not.
                  
               That the behaviour is basically undefined if the input includes wildcards
               characters. Normally, wildcards in the last part of path provided on 
               input are resolved to the first corresponding item found on the disk, 
               but it is better not to rely on that and use other more suitable functions
               if working with wildcards like FindFirst/FindNext.
