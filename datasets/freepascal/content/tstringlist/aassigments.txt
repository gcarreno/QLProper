     Var TheList : TStringList; AFILENAME : String = 'MyFile.txt';

       TheList := TStringList.Create;
         Try

           ListBox1.Items.Assign(  TheList ); 
         finally
           TheList.Free;
    end;
 end;

  Note: The TStringList TheList is created and a text file is read into the TheList.
              Memo1 is cleared and TheList is added to Memo1. TheList is assigned to
              Listbox1.
