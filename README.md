The polemic Quick List program with original data and more intuitive User Interface.

This all started due to this [post](https://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php/topic,53571.0.html) on the Lazarus forums under the Beginners section by [JLWest](https://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php?action=profile;u=61978).
